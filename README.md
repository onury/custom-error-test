# Custom Errors in JavaScript

Custom errors are useful when you want to track code with context-specific information. There are several ways to define a custom error in JavaScript. But since inheritance is not a first-citizen feature in JS (until ES2015); there's also so much discussion on how to implement a proper custom error.

This module tests various implementations for custom errors, widely used by developers; such as methods making use of `Error.call()`, `Object.create()`, `new Error()`, `Object.setPrototypeOf()`, `extends` (ES2015) and `util.inherits` (Node). See `/errors` directory for [included implementations][errors-dir].

What we expect from a custom error implementation is:
- `e.constructor.name` MUST get our custom error name.
- `E.prototype` MUST inherit from `Error.prototype`.
- `e.message` MUST be set.
- `e` MUST be an instance of `Error`.
- `e` MUST be an instance of `CustomError`.
- `e.stack` MUST be set and should have line-tracable info.
- `e.tostring()` MUST return error name and/or message.
- `({}).toString.call(e)` SHOULD output `"error"`.
- and some more...

`npm i custom-error-test` to install.  

### Test

Run `npm start` which will output test results to console for the current Node.js environment. And will also generate an HTML file, which will display results for the used browser. 

Better, you can [directly view this page][test-page] for testing your current browser.
